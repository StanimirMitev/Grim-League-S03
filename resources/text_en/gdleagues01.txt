tagGDLeagueRolderathisKey1=<----I---->How Benny and the Boys Got Real Rich and Probably Became Lords<----I---->
tagGDLeagueRolderathisKeyDescription1=If 'yer readin' this, then this tombs already been plucked by Benny and the boys! But yer not leavin' empty handed, no, cause yer good pal Benny is gonna give ya the story of a lifetime. I call it "How Benny and the Boys got real rich and probably became lords."{^n}{^n}It all started when I was pissing away the daylight at one of my usual haunts out near burrwitch. I was gonna meet the boys for a drink and wait for the sun to go down so we could dig up a few corpses, maybe get some finery to sell. That's when this sullen fella came up to me, and- on menhir- a winter breeze followed 'im in, cut through the summer heat it did! He tells me about the score of a lifetime, corpses buried with mountains of gold. He barely got a word out afore I sprinted outta there! That blabber mouth was gonna tell anyone that would listen about MY treasure, nobody is gonna beat old Benny to the punch, no sir.{^n}{^n}I was already spendin' the coin in my head afore we even loaded the wagon. According to that spooky fella, this was gonna be a big job, so I gathered the boys: "Slippy" is crack with the dynamite, blow us a new entrance iffin he has to, "Bigun" is the size of three men and can carry the gold out like a pack mule, and "Marge" is well ... Marge is funny, and this is gonna be a long trip.{^n}{^n}It was a full day afore we made it to the cave. Now, caves aren't no different than tombs, 'cept maybe a bit damper and more humid. This cave were a different story. Further we got in, the colder it got, and it weren't no normal cold, neither. Felt like no matter how much we bundled up, the cold cut right through and it weren't just cold in me body, it was like, me head was gettin' froze to its core. It's almost like there was a delay between me thoughts and me actions. Sooner we get the gold and leave, the better.
tagGDLeagueRolderathisKey2=<----II---->How the Heist Went Pear Shaped for Benny and the Boys<----II---->
tagGDLeagueRolderathisKeyDescription2=Just like that sullen fella' said, we found this wall that weren't like the others. It was made from black stone and marked top to bottom with these carvings, all surrounding a carving of this man with antlers on his head and a cold indifference in his eyes. I ain't sure why, but I just had to reach out and touch it. My fingers found the grooves in the stone, it was freezing to the touch. The cold crawled up my fingers, past my eyes, an' dug deep into my skull. My limbs fell numb and my vision went blank, and that when I seent it ...  a blizzard that washed everything in white. A hundred thousand men, slouched over in the snow, like they was prayin', but not a speck of skin to be had between em, jus' bare muscle and blackened bones. Up on a hill, was the same sullen man from the bar. He looked to me. No, he looked through me- he spoke words that rattled me insides. His tone were kind an' understandin, but his word weren't. "Your flesh and blood will feed the winter winds. Your bones will march to my command." {^n}{^n}Luckily, "Marge" was able to snap me out of it afore slippy blew the wall to little bits. Now the wind howled from the hole like a wounded beast, colder than ever. I looked down the hallway, and something hit me, a tought I weren't able to shake. This is a tomb, jus' like the ones I robbed out in burrwitch, but this one is mine. I knew I was gonna die here, but I marched anyway.
tagGDLeagueRolderathisKey3=<----III---->How the Heist went Pear Shaped for Benny and the Boys<----III---->
tagGDLeagueRolderathisKeyDescription3=My mind stood still, as my body moved. I wanted to scream for the boys to run, to leave me behind, but I couldn't. I was frozen solid behind my own eyes. I watched as I lead my only friends to their death.{^n}{^n}We eventually came to a large room what almost looked like a church. Up at the lectern, the sullen man stared through me and for the first time, I truly saw him. Black and frostbitten bones clung together with wretched magic hung over the pulpit like a specter. Its shriveled, pale blue eyes met mine and widened, like we shared a secret. I heard the sound of ice cracking, and it vanished before reappearing, blocking our only exit.{^n}{^n}"Bigun" was the first to go, as that thing stretched its arm out only to freeze him in place. He shrieked in pain as he was frozen solid. I can still hear his voice as his lungs filled with ice and his skin sloughed off. "Slippy" tried to get past 'im, but an icicle to the neck stopped him dead in his tracks. "Marge" on the other hand, tried to beg for her life. I wanted so badly for her prayers to be answered, but this ain't the merciful kinda god. Prostrate on her hands an' knees, just like the flayed men, marge got her response in the form of a great shard of ice crushing her from above. Least it was quick. I turned toward the thing, accepting my death, but it just walked away. Why ... Why me?
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKey1=<----I---->A Fragment of Starlight<----I---->
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKeyDescription1=(As you hold this shimmering fragment of starlight in your hands, you hear a voice calling you out from within){^n}{^n}If you are holding this, it means I have been slain by Ballog'Nath. I have known for some time that our struggle against the void is fruitless, but perhaps, in death, I can impart some knowledge so you may better prepare yourself against these terrors.{^n}{^n}Much like the void itself, Ballog'Nath is endless- an entire legion designed to overwhelm and swallow the stars. The key to conquering it is to know intimately what it can do. {^n}{^n}Ballog'Nath seeks to cover all of reality in an eternal flame, the longer you struggle against it, the less you will be able to shelter yourself from it's horrid jets of hellfire. Dare not to focus all of your attention to the ground before you, for Ballog'Nath will summon a great meteor to crush larger foes that will leave you dazed and susceptible to a vicious blow from its claws. However, the real power of the fearsome Ballog'Nath lies in the ability to conjure shades of itself that will quickly overwhelm.{^n}{^n}
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKey2=<----II---->A Fragment of Starlight<----II---->
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKeyDescription2=The shade of ashen grey is a fearsome shade that will rip through you with a mighty slash that pierces through even the strongest of armor and cuts directly into your very life force, leaving even the strongest of foes clinging to life. It is a primevil hunter that will leap through reality to chase down its quarry and attempting to run will only trigger its instincts.{^n}{^n}The crimson specter manipulates the void wrought energies to bring chaos and devastation to the battlefield. Stay far from the horrid twister of flame, for it will weaken the will of even the most battle hardened warrior and leave you fragile. If you see a patch of hellwrought crystal forming in the ground, be wary, for it will burst and send shockwaves rippling through reality. Perhaps it's most devastating ability is a flurry of mighty shards of stone that fall from the sky, devastating even the sturdiest of defenses.{^n}{^n}I can feel my connection to this world fading, Warrior ... I will seek you out again, perhaps in another reality.
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKey3=<----III---->A Fragment of Starlight<----III---->
tagGDLeagueBallogNathKeyDescription3=(As you hold the quickly fading sliver of starlight, you hear a voice weakly calling out to you from within){^n}{^n}Warrior! I haven't much time left, I can feel my consciousness fading quickly. I must finish telling you all I know about the fearsome Ballog'Nath so you may defend your world against the terrible legion.{^n}{^n}The sapphire shade brings with it a veritable army in it's wake. It can tear through perforations in reality itself to bring legions of devoted followers to aid it in battle. Be weary not of its human followers, but of its horrifying golems, that can crush even the strongest foes with terrifying speed and power.{^n}{^n}The final shade, that of emerald green, is the one that I know the least about. It seems to emanate a great power, of that I'm certain. Beyond that, its capabilities seem shrouded.{^n}{^n}I have given you all the information I have, Warrior. Now you must defend your reality against the endless scourge. Succeed where I have failed!
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKey1=<----I---->In Pursuit of Perfection<----I---->
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKeyDescription1=Theodin Marcell is nothing but a butcher, his designs lacks nuance and artistry. I will show everyone what it means to behold true power.{^n}{^n}My beast will be a perfect amalgamation of living stone and flesh. It will wreath the unworthy in aetherfire, crush the weak with unstoppable force, and choke the living with vile toxins.{^n}{^n}Its blows will follow a perfect cadence, meeting a crescendo of destruction. Battles will be won entirely by my beasts hand- it will soften the front line with a barrage of toxic artillery, turning lesser beings into pure stone and leaving stronger foes vulnerable. Then it will break the front lines with a mighty charge.{^n}{^n}When my people see my perfect design, they will forget about the so called "Shaper of Flesh" and they will instead worship at the artistry of Magistrate Le'Sais.
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKey2=<----II---->In Pursuit of Perfection<----II---->
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKeyDescription2=It is nearly done, but something is missing ... A creature of such perfection should leave an impression. I want the lucky survivors to tell the tales of the walking mountain.{^n}{^n}They will gather around their fires and tell each other of how the mountain grew to colossal heights and towered over the battlefield. They will sing dour songs of how their inevitable fate slowly marched towards them, unwavering, unaffected by even the strongest of weapons. Brick and mortar walls will stand no chance against the mighty flurry of blows unleashed by my beast.{^n}{^n}As men come to scour the battlefield for their fallen comrades, they shall see the horrible legacy of the mountain, a field of toxic shard and crystal that will remain until the end of time, unable to be affected by even the most powerful weapon or spell.{^n}{^n}My work is nearly complete. I will elevate my kind with this magnum opus.
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKey3=<----III---->In Pursuit of Perfection<----III---->
tagGDLeagueGalakrosKeyDescription3=To see my creation work was like poetry in motion. I was able to find a small village tucked away in the crags- the perfect hunting ground. It took mere moments for my beast to level the entire plaza, turning it into a smoldering heap. A woman attempted to sneak away with a group of children, but the mountain crushed them before they could cry for help, turning them into a crater of bloody pulp. There was an attempt to muster a militia to stop it, but their bullets weren't able to pierce it's hide. Yes- It is ready. The armies of men and chaos will be ground to dust before me!
